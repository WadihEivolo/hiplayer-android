<h3>Optional (Setup a new project)</h3>

In Android Studio, create a new project of type **Empty Activity.**

If your project is already created, you can skip this step.

Our player works with both Kotlin and Java. Yet, you will need to note which language you are using for later reference.

For the Android Minimum SDK, choose API 21. Earlier APIs can also be supported if needed. When done, click Finish to create the project.
